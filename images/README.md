This images directory is intended for the Reference document, since it will contain many of the same images multiple times.

Images for the various content notebooks should not be placed in this directory, but rather they should be directly embedded in their notebook.

This approach has the advantage of making the content notebooks self contained and individually redistributable.

If the Reference document turns out to not contain many of the same images, or otherwise there is no efficiency advantage in having images separate from it, then we should similiarly embed images in it.
